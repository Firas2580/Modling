The right way to installation of tools is so easy , arrange them like below:

firstly we will fixed the Base on table , after that we put a Waist on Base , take the Arm 01 to instal it with Waist ( Knowing that the bottom of the Arm 01 contains a small piece for the wires to pass through ) , after that instal the Arm 02 with Arm 01 ( clipped side of Arm 02 on above ) , finally instal the Gripper at the end of arduino_arm

best wishs,
